Dear Raj,

Thank you for the update.  
Could you please advise on the **maximum threshold and scalability limit** — specifically, how the **system handles high concurrent requests and load distribution** during peak login hours?

We are already observing around **40K+ logins today**, and the user base is rapidly increasing. It’s important to validate that our **backend and API layers can sustain the projected load** to prevent similar production issues in the future.

Please note, our team is also working on **home screen optimization** and coordinating with **business stakeholders** to enhance **user experience** and reduce **unnecessary backend calls**.

Appreciate your prompt analysis and confirmation.
