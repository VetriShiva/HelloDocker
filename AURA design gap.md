# Design Gap Observation â€“ AURA Card Inquiry (Online vs Offline Mode)

**To:** ESB / Integration Team  
**From:** Vetri

**Subject:** Design Gap Observation â€“ AURA Card Inquiry (Online vs Offline Mode)

---

## Summary

As per my understanding, this appears to be a **design gap from ESB** related to the AURA card inquiry process.

---

## Implementation Details

- **PR 1:** Implemented **only online mode**  
  ðŸ”— [View PR 1](https://dev.azure.com.mcas.ms/nbkcloud/Weyay/_git/dvp-server/pullrequest/6815)

- **PR 2:** Implemented **fallback mechanism (online â†’ offline)** based on ESBâ€™s suggestion  
  ðŸ”— [View PR 2](https://dev.azure.com.mcas.ms/nbkcloud/Weyay/_git/dvp-server/pullrequest/7944)

## Identified Design Gap

- The **offline mode** does not return balance information, as mentioned in ESBâ€™s previous communication.  
- Later, ESB indicated that an **offline query** would be implemented, but this is still pending.  
- As per the design, **digital card details should be available on the same day**, which is not currently happening.

---

## Current Impact

- **AURA inquiry fails in offline mode** due to missing offline implementation.  
- This feature was not implemented in the initial release and remains pending.  
- Consequently, **balance information is unavailable** even for recently onboarded users.

---

## Next Steps

Kindly review and advise on the next steps from ESBâ€™s end to ensure consistent behavior across both **online and offline modes**.

# AURA Inquiry â€“ Offline Mode Observation

**Author:** Vetri  
**Date:** 21-Oct-2025  
**Purpose:** To document current system behavior for AURA inquiry when FISERV MQ is down.  
**Note:** This design and implementation were done by a previous developer; this note is purely for clarity and team alignment.

---

## Summary

During analysis of the **AURA inquiry scenario**, we observed that the issue occurs when the system switches to **offline mode** during FISERV MQ downtime.

---

## Observations

- The **offline inquiry response** does not include the balance field (`balType = "Avail"`) that the UI expects for displaying card balance.  
- In **offline mode**, there are **no instant (same-day) card records** available, since the data is based on **T-1 information** from the backend system.  
- This behavior matches the earlier understanding that **offline query support** was planned for later implementation as per ESB communication.

---

## Reference Implementations

- [PR 6815 â€“ Online mode only](https://dev.azure.com.mcas.ms/nbkcloud/Weyay/_git/dvp-server/pullrequest/6815)  
- [PR 7944 â€“ Online-to-offline fallback enhancement](https://dev.azure.com.mcas.ms/nbkcloud/Weyay/_git/dvp-server/pullrequest/7944)

---

## Remarks

- The above behavior reflects **existing design** implemented by a **previous developer**.  
- This document is **not an escalation** but intended only to **keep all teams aligned** on the current design and inquiry flow.  
- Further validation from ESB/FISERV side may help confirm if offline inquiry can be extended to return required balance data for consistency.

# RE: Weyay | CreditCards/1.0/CreditCardDetails API Failure Impact

**From:** Vetri  
**Purpose:** Brief, non-escalatory clarification from MAS side.

---

During analysis of the **AURA inquiry** scenario, we observed the issue occurs when the system switches to **offline mode** during FISERV MQ downtime.

- **Offline response** does not include the balance field (`balType = "Avail"`) expected by the UI.  
- **No instant (same-day) card records** are available in offline mode because it relies on **T-1 data**.  
- This matches the earlier understanding that **offline query support** was planned for later implementation.

*Note:* The current behavior reflects an **existing design implemented by a previous developer**. Sharing only for alignment.
