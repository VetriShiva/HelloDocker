## Summary

As per my understanding, this appears to be a **design gap from ESB** related to the AURA card inquiry process.

## Implementation Details

- **PR 1:** Implemented **only online mode**

## Identified Design Gap

- The **offline mode** does not return balance information, as mentioned in ESBâ€™s previous communication.  
- Later, ESB indicated that an **offline query** would be implemented, but this is still pending.  
- As per the design, **digital card details should be available on the same day**, which is not currently happening.

---

## Current Impact

- **AURA inquiry fails in offline mode** due to missing offline implementation.  
- This feature was not implemented in the initial release and remains pending.  
- Consequently, **balance information is unavailable** even for recently onboarded users.

## Next Steps

Kindly review and advise on the next steps from ESBâ€™s end to ensure consistent behavior across both **online and offline modes**.
