Hereâ€™s a polished, professional, presentation-style email draft you can send to Business and the Product Owner:
Subject: Aura Customer vs Active Login vs Fiserv Inquiry Count â€“ Discussion on Home Screen Design Impact
Dear [Business Team / Product Owner],
We have completed the analysis comparing Aura customer count, active login, and Fiserv inquiry data.
Aura registered customers: 14,000
Active login count: 68,868
Fiserv inquiry count: 278,526
This shows a significant deviation (around 5x increase) primarily due to our current home screen layout, which triggers multiple background service calls through widgets such as App Map, Best for You, and Whatâ€™s Next.
As a team, we believe this is the right time to review our design approach and find a balanced solution â€” both from business (UX perspective) and IT (performance and scalability perspective).
Our collective goal is to enhance the customer experience while ensuring efficient backend utilization.
I suggest an open discussion to align on next steps and define an alternate approach that avoids such incidents in the future.
Your continued support and collaboration are much appreciated as we work together to deliver a seamless and sustainable user experience.
Best regards,
Vetri

Would you like me to convert this into a PowerPoint presentation (1â€“2 slides) format as you requested earlier (e.g., summary slide + proposed next steps)?




# Subject: Aura Customer vs Active Login vs Fiserv Inquiry Count â€“ Discussion on Home Screen Design Impact  

**Dear Business Team / Product Owner,**

Thank you for sharing the details and supporting the analysis.  
We have completed the comparison between **Aura customer count**, **active login**, and **Fiserv inquiry** data.  

- **Aura registered customers:** 14,000  
- **Active login count:** 68,868  
- **Fiserv inquiry count:** 278,526  

This shows a **significant deviation (around 5x increase)** primarily due to our current **home screen layout**, which triggers multiple background service calls through widgets such as **App Map**, **Best for You**, and **Whatâ€™s Next**.  

As a team, we believe this is the **right time to review our design approach** and find a **balanced solution** â€” both from:  
- **Business (UX perspective)**  
- **IT (performance and scalability perspective)**  

Our **collective goal** is to enhance the **customer experience** while ensuring **efficient backend utilization**.  
I suggest an **open discussion** to align on next steps and define an alternate approach that avoids such incidents in the future.  

As a **kind request to BR**, we recommend reviewing the **current customer-facing delay (loader)** on the **home screen**, which has increased after introducing new features such as **Whatâ€™s Next**, **Best for You**, **Available Balance**, and **3D Pending Authorization**.  
Addressing this from a **business and design perspective** will help us deliver a smoother and faster experience for our customers.  

> **Note:** This BR request is for **performance optimization and user experience improvement** â€” it is **not related to any production bug or incident**.
