Here’s a polished, professional, presentation-style email draft you can send to Business and the Product Owner:
Subject: Aura Customer vs Active Login vs Fiserv Inquiry Count – Discussion on Home Screen Design Impact
Dear [Business Team / Product Owner],
We have completed the analysis comparing Aura customer count, active login, and Fiserv inquiry data.
Aura registered customers: 14,000
Active login count: 68,868
Fiserv inquiry count: 278,526
This shows a significant deviation (around 5x increase) primarily due to our current home screen layout, which triggers multiple background service calls through widgets such as App Map, Best for You, and What’s Next.
As a team, we believe this is the right time to review our design approach and find a balanced solution — both from business (UX perspective) and IT (performance and scalability perspective).
Our collective goal is to enhance the customer experience while ensuring efficient backend utilization.
I suggest an open discussion to align on next steps and define an alternate approach that avoids such incidents in the future.
Your continued support and collaboration are much appreciated as we work together to deliver a seamless and sustainable user experience.
Best regards,
Vetri
Weyay – MAS Engineering
Would you like me to convert this into a PowerPoint presentation (1–2 slides) format as you requested earlier (e.g., summary slide + proposed next steps)?
