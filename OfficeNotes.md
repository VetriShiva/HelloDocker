Applying after 10 PM can actually increase your chances of getting an interview - here’s why:
❌_Less competition_: Never apply on Monday/weekday Morning. Fewer people apply late at night, so your application stands out.
❌ _Automated filters_: Some applicant tracking systems (ATS) might prioritize or notice late-night applications.
❌Timings matter: If you apply at 9am Monday your resume gets burried under hundreds within few hours. 
❌ It’s timing more than luck: By the time the recruiter check you are already on page 17 of the pile. 
Here are the hacks: 
✅ Apply after 10pm when most people are asleep. 
✅ Fewer applications at night=higher chances of getting reviewed. 
✅It’s not luck, it’s timing and smart working. 
I tested this myself- the same resume got ignored in the morning but shortlisted at night. 
Want a ATS optimized Resume Template + Cold Email Hack that ensures you land on the top of the stack?

✅Comment cold email and I’ll send it you within few days. 
That being said, it’s not a rule, and quality of your application matters most! 😊

5 things you should lie about in your job interview 
5️⃣ Salary expectations✅
 - Why: Sharing a number can anchor your salary negotiations too low or make you seem out of touch.
 - How to handle: Research industry standards and say, “Based on the role and my experience, I’m looking for a salary in the ₹X–₹Y range.”
4️⃣ Why you’re leaving your current job❓❓❓❓
 - Why: Venting about a toxic workplace or saying you’re “just looking for a change” can raise red flags.
 - How to handle: Focus on what you’re moving _toward_: “I’m excited about this opportunity because it aligns with my career goals and offers growth in [area].”
3️⃣Gaps in employment🤫
 - Why: Highlighting gaps can lead to unnecessary scrutiny.
 - How to handle: Briefly mention skills you honed during the gap (freelancing, courses, caregiving) and steer back to your strengths.
2️⃣Weaknesses💯
 - Why: Sharing a real weakness might hurt your chances.
 - How to handle: Pick a “safe” area for growth (e.g., “I tend to be a perfectionist, so I’ve been working on balancing speed and quality”).
1️⃣ Your availability for odd hours or travel❌
 - Why: Saying “I’m totally flexible” can lead to being overworked.
 - How to handle: If asked, clarify your boundaries respectfully: “I’m generally flexible, but let’s discuss specifics of the role.”

10 boundaries to maintain with your colleagues
1. 🤫Don’t overshare your personal life. Don’t overshare your financial problems. Don’t share about your spouse or future plans. 
2. 😇Be Friendly not friends. There’s a difference.
3. 🌚Avoid gossips. Some people just gossip to check if you play along. 
4. 😅Say no without guilt. Over helping kills your own productivity. 
5. 🤘🏻Don’t mix flirting with professionalism. It gets too dirty. 
6. 🗣️Set clear response time. You are not available 24*7.
7. 🧠Protect your ideas. Not every brainstorm needs to be public. 
8. ✡️Don’t join every group chat. Your peace is not up for debate. 
9. 😖Try to disengage from any drama. Don’t take any sides. 
10. 👩‍💻Remember- It’s work not family. You owe professionalism and not emotional labor.

Someone stole your idea and got promoted for it.
Now you guard everything.
Share a strategy? You fear, they will take credit.
Help a colleague? You fear that they will replace you.
That reaction is understandable.
When you have been burned once, your brain stops optimizing for growth and starts optimizing for safety.
But here is the uncomfortable truth:
If you play defence for too long, you become even more invisible.
The shift is not “be generous and trust everyone.”
The shift is “be generous strategically.”
Because you can help others without dimming your flame.
And when done right - it signals status, authority, and leadership maturity.
Here are 3 ways to do that:
𝟭. 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗮𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗮 𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗺𝗽
Send a short note after key discussions: “As discussed, my recommendation is X. Next step is Y.”
This creates a clean record without sounding defensive.
𝟮. 𝗚𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱
“A led the execution. I shaped the approach and aligned stakeholders.”
Credit them and still anchor your contribution.
𝟯. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗮 𝗯𝘆 𝗼𝘄𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗮𝗿𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲
In meetings, frame the logic, trade offs, and decision path.
People can copy an idea. They cannot copy the thinking that produced it.
The goal is not to hide your contributions, it is to make them undeniable.
🧩📈 Because generosity without witnesses is a leak. Generosity visible to the right people is leverage.🧩📈 
Promotions don’t just go to the hardest workers, they go to those who are seen as future leaders.
That’s exactly what I help professionals achieve with my 21-Day Path to Promotion Workbook, packed with practical, proven strategies to shift perception, amplify leadership presence, and secure the promotion + raise you’ve earned.
📩 Drop a ‘PATH’ in the comments and I’ll share the link directly.
