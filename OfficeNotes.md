Applying after 10 PM can actually increase your chances of getting an interview - here’s why:
❌_Less competition_: Never apply on Monday/weekday Morning. Fewer people apply late at night, so your application stands out.
❌ _Automated filters_: Some applicant tracking systems (ATS) might prioritize or notice late-night applications.
❌Timings matter: If you apply at 9am Monday your resume gets burried under hundreds within few hours. 
❌ It’s timing more than luck: By the time the recruiter check you are already on page 17 of the pile. 
Here are the hacks: 
✅ Apply after 10pm when most people are asleep. 
✅ Fewer applications at night=higher chances of getting reviewed. 
✅It’s not luck, it’s timing and smart working. 
I tested this myself- the same resume got ignored in the morning but shortlisted at night. 
Want a ATS optimized Resume Template + Cold Email Hack that ensures you land on the top of the stack?

5 things you should lie about in your job interview 
5️⃣ Salary expectations✅
 - Why: Sharing a number can anchor your salary negotiations too low or make you seem out of touch.
 - How to handle: Research industry standards and say, “Based on the role and my experience, I’m looking for a salary in the ₹X–₹Y range.”
4️⃣ Why you’re leaving your current job❓❓❓❓
 - Why: Venting about a toxic workplace or saying you’re “just looking for a change” can raise red flags.
 - How to handle: Focus on what you’re moving _toward_: “I’m excited about this opportunity because it aligns with my career goals and offers growth in [area].”
3️⃣Gaps in employment🤫
 - Why: Highlighting gaps can lead to unnecessary scrutiny.
 - How to handle: Briefly mention skills you honed during the gap (freelancing, courses, caregiving) and steer back to your strengths.
2️⃣Weaknesses💯
 - Why: Sharing a real weakness might hurt your chances.
 - How to handle: Pick a “safe” area for growth (e.g., “I tend to be a perfectionist, so I’ve been working on balancing speed and quality”).
1️⃣ Your availability for odd hours or travel❌
 - Why: Saying “I’m totally flexible” can lead to being overworked.
 - How to handle: If asked, clarify your boundaries respectfully: “I’m generally flexible, but let’s discuss specifics of the role.”
