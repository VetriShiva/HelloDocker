Here’s a refined, professional, and polished version of your email for the second context 👇
Subject: Credit Card Inquiry – Excessive Requests & Proposed Solutions
Hi Team,
We’ve observed that the credit card inquiry API is receiving more requests than the actual number of customers. As a channel, we’re unable to maintain the portfolio state (e.g., whether a user holds an Aura card—which is technically a credit card with zero balance—or any other loan/prepaid product).
Since ESB is considered the source of truth as per MAS’s design, we depend on ESB for accurate portfolio details. While CBG leverages a dedicated Portfolio API (which helps avoid heavy traffic), Weyay currently doesn’t have this capability—hence the higher request volume.
We appreciate your findings and support, which have been very helpful in stabilizing the Weyay side. To move forward, I’d like to propose two possible solutions for your review:
Lightweight Entity Changes API:
Returns the last updated timestamp for all entities linked to a customer.
Channels can poll this API periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes, based on business use case and ESB’s confirmation).
Event-Driven Architecture:
ESB notifies the channel whenever an entity or product is created/updated.
This minimizes unnecessary network calls and ensures real-time synchronization.
Kindly review these options and share your recommendation on the best approach to align with business needs.
Best regards,
Vetri

Here’s a professional, concise, and polished version of your email for the 3DS issue 👇
Subject: 3DS – Pending Authorization Handling (Common for Weyay and CBG)
Hi Team,
Based on our RCA, we observed that the 3DS journey differs between CBG and Weyay. In Weyay, the API is invoked from the home screen, whereas CBG does not trigger it there. As per our analysis, the API currently throws an error instead of a warning when queried for a customer without pending authorizations.
We request your review on this, as resolving it will help reduce workload spikes on both ESB and MAS.
Our proposed solution is to make this session-based — since the business requires displaying pending authorizations on the home screen (for cases where users miss push notifications), we can cache or manage this per session. This would significantly reduce repetitive calls from MAS to ESB for such edge cases and optimize server resource usage.
Kindly review and share your feedback on the proposed approach.
Best regards,
Vetri
Would you like me to create a shorter version (for quick escalation mail) or keep this as a discussion-oriented professional draft?


Here’s a professional and polished version of your email draft 👇
Subject: Deposit Pending Transaction – High Request Volume from MAS to ESB
Hi Team,
Based on our RCA, the recent business requirement to display both available balance and current balance has resulted in heavy traffic from MAS to ESB. For MAS, ESB remains the source of truth to fetch balance details, which currently depends on the Deposit Pending API for calculation.
We request your input on how best to handle this scenario, as MAS will continue to follow ESB’s direction for consistency.
Appreciate your continued support and efforts in helping stabilize the environment.
Best regards,
Vetri
Would you like me to make it a bit shorter for management visibility (2–3 lines summary + one-line request), or keep this tone for technical discussion with integration leads?



Here’s a professional and polished draft for your portfolio API context 👇
Subject: Portfolio API – Proposed Solution to Address VMX Timeout Issue
Hi Team,
Based on our RCA, the VMX timeout issue occurs because we don’t maintain a customer’s portfolio state within MAS. As a result, multiple ESB API calls are made separately for each product type — prepaid, loan, credit card (including Aura Prepaid), and others.
Instead of multiple sequential requests, a unified Portfolio API would significantly optimize this process by consolidating product information in a single call. This approach will help reduce load spikes on both ESB and MAS, improving overall response performance and stability.
Kindly review and share your inputs on the feasibility of introducing this enhancement.
Best regards,
Vetri
Would you like me to make this slightly executive-friendly (for wider management circulation) or keep it technical-focused for integration team discussion?



Here’s a polished, professional, and management-facing version of your email draft 👇
Subject: Weyay Loan Product – Stabilization Plan and Key Optimization Areas
Dear Team,
Following our RCA on the Weyay Loan product performance, we have identified several key areas that require optimization to ensure stability and scalability:
PDF Generation:
The loan contract PDF generation should be moved to Orion Pro instead of MAS to support scalability as user volumes increase.
This design gap originated due to earlier LOS integration constraints.
User Document Conversion:
Currently, user documents (e.g., JPG/PNG) are being converted to PDF on the fly within MAS.
This should ideally be handled at the LOS layer to reduce processing overhead.
Loan Tracker Journey:
At present, MAS continuously polls for RO changes to update user status.
This should be redesigned using an event-driven architecture to minimize unnecessary network calls and improve responsiveness.
Final Contract Generation:
The final loan contract PDF should also be generated via Orion Pro, as the current MAS-based implementation was introduced temporarily to meet business deadlines.
Contract Signing Polling:
Each polling cycle currently transmits the entire 4 MB contract file from MAS → ESB → KMID App, consuming significant bandwidth and resources across systems.
Optimization is required to minimize payload and frequency.
Temporary Business Flag:
A temporary flag enabled in production for business continuity needs confirmation for removal post-stabilization.
These enhancements will improve performance, scalability, and maintainability across MAS, ESB, and LOS. Kindly review and confirm the next steps to align with business priorities.
Best regards,
Vetri
Would you like me to make a summary version (5–6 lines) suitable for a quick business update or keep this detailed technical summary for management + business stakeholders?


Here’s a short, professional, and polished version of your email 👇
Subject: Weyay vs CBG – ESB Hit Comparison and Optimization Approach
Hi Team,
Based on our RCA, Weyay currently lacks a single ESB API to retrieve the complete customer portfolio (Prepaid, Credit Card – Aura Prepaid, Loan, etc.). As MAS depends on ESB as the source of truth, we are required to call multiple APIs to construct the portfolio, resulting in higher ESB load.
While CBG’s portfolio API is designed for heavy use, we need to explore a lightweight alternative API dedicated to Weyay to reduce risk and improve efficiency. This will also be critical as we plan to onboard the Credit Card module, where similar challenges are expected.
Kindly review and share your inputs on the possible optimization approach.
Best regards,
Vetri
Would you like me to make it even shorter (for email threads) or keep this balanced version (clear but concise)?


That’s a very good instinct, Vetri — staying polite, factual, and professional even when others are defensive is the right approach.
Here’s how you can handle it strategically and gracefully 👇
🎯 Objective:
Maintain a healthy relationship while clearly establishing accountability — facts, not emotions.
✅ Recommended Mail Draft to UAT Manager (Polite + Firm + Collaborative)
Subject: Clarification on Weyay Loan UAT Scenario and Next Steps
Hi [UAT Manager’s Name],
Hope you’re doing well.
I’d like to bring to your attention that the recent production issue in the Weyay Loan flow matches a case observed during the T4 UAT phase. We have supporting backend logs and timestamps indicating similar error behavior.
I completely understand there may have been differences in test assumptions or environment configurations. However, since this is a financial transaction journey, I believe it’s important for us to align on the RCA together — not to assign blame, but to strengthen our joint validation process and avoid similar incidents in production.
Would it be possible to have a short sync between our teams to review the logs, test evidence, and close this loop collaboratively?
Appreciate your support as always.
Best regards,
Vetri
💡 Tips to Stay Professional Yet Firm
Use facts, not blame. Attach or reference your proof only if needed (“we have supporting backend logs”).
Invite collaboration. Phrases like “align on RCA together” show maturity and teamwork.
Keep emotion out. Avoid “you missed” or “your team failed.” Use “we observed” or “it appears.”
CC your manager — not as escalation, but as transparency.
If UAT argues again, reply calmly:
“Thanks for your inputs. Let’s validate this together based on logs and evidence so we can close it constructively.”
Would you like me to prepare a short Teams/Chat version of this (2–3 lines) — something you can send before or after this email to set the tone?
